 My first techdegree project!

 In this project I attempted (hopefully successfully) to create a random quote generator using the skills I've learned from Javascript Techdegree course (as well as a little css too).

 I was also able to add an additional quote object property, tags, as well as set a timer that auto-refreshed quotes every 10 seconds.
